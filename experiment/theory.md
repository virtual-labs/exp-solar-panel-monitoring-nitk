### Theory:

A thermal camera is a device that creates an image using infrared radiation, similar to a normal camera that forms an image using visible light. Instead of the 400–700 nanometre (nm) range of the visible light camera, infrared cameras are sensitive to wavelengths from about 1,000 nm to about 14,000 nm. Special thermal sensors in the cameras read these waves, and the data is processed to produce a visible image, acting much like traditional optical cameras. However, unlike regular RGB cameras, a thermal camera collects light waves that we can view with our eyes. 
Heat and light are both parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but a camera that can detect visible light won't see thermal energy and vice versa. Thermal cameras capture infrared energy and use the data to create images through digital or analog video outputs. The principle of infrared thermography is based on the physical phenomenon that anybody of a temperature above absolute zero (-273.15 °C) emits electromagnetic radiation. There is a clear correlation between the surface of a body and the intensity and spectral composition of its emitted radiation.

**Application**
1. Thermal cameras have been just as instrumental in industrial inspection, where they have been used to track temperature differences during pipeline inspections and monitor infrared radiation from power lines. The ability to read heat and watch the temperature difference of a subject is an invaluable resource.
2. Though drones with traditional cameras have been leveraged in the real estate market for years, thermal drones can also prove valuable. The ability to inspect a building or home for any insulation problems or leaks can have an enormous impact on an assessment.
3. Thermal drones are aiding farmers with agriculture as well. Thermal imaging allows for advanced insight into plant disease and livestock monitoring in the farms
4. Energy surveys and audits
5. Leaks in industries 
6. Water damage and excess moisture
7. Condensation
8. Areas with missing or non-performing insulation
9. The effectiveness of insulation in the construction of a new building
10. Areas of air leakage or movement
11. Monitoring and replacing solar cells in solar panels.
